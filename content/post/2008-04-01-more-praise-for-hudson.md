Over on the Maven2 Users list a recent poster asked what CI server was best, and Hudson was the only answer.

Then Jason van Zyl posted [this praise for Hudson](http://www.nabble.com/continuous-integration-server-tt16662773s177.html):

> I know from my vantage point Hudson is the only system I will provide commercial support for at Sonatype because the battle is over. Hudson won by making developers  lives' easier. Kohsuke will go to no end to make things easier for users.

> At any rate I guarantee you that inside 3 months Hudson will have the best Maven integration of any CI/Build Server there is.

I'm personally biased towards Hudson, but I have to agree that it has won the war of the CI servers. I don't see anything coming close in ease of use or speed of startup.
