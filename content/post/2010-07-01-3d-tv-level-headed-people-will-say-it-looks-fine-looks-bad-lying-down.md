I had my first oportunity to see the new 3D TV's this weekend.  They looked OK to me.  There was a 3D effect.  All around me were people who were going "wow! this is great! this is absolutely fantastic!".

But then I tilted my head, and low and behold, because the system uses horizontal separation to deliver 3D, it requires that your eyes be horizontally separated in order to deliver the 3D effect... when your eyes are vertical, however, it looks just as shit as when you have not got the glasses on.

Now I don't know about you, but one of my favoured ways of watching TV is lying on the couch with my head turned sideways to face rthe TV... which results in my eyes being vertical not horizontal...

So I'll add that to the top of the list of reasons why I'll not be buying a 1st generation 3D TV
