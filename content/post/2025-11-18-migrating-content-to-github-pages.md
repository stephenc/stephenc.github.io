About 19 years ago, I set up a blog on Google’s Blogger platform to track my adventures learning Java: [https://javaadventure.blogspot.com/](https://javaadventure.blogspot.com/)

The platform has changed a lot since then, and not always for the better. Many posts no longer render the way they used to, and a few images have disappeared entirely.

One feature I really loved, which is now broken, was the ability to email a special address and have the message automatically turned into a post. It made publishing effortless… though that was also before I discovered what was then X (née Twitter).

I’ve tried exploring other hosting platforms, but none give me the level of control over my content that I want. And then this weekend I had a facepalm moment: why not just use the root of my GitHub Pages site?

So here we go. I’m giving technical blogging another shot.

If it’s fun, I’ll keep going.

*Note:* Right now I’m using this GitHub-inspired Hugo theme: [https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style](https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style), we’ll see how long it lasts before I get the itch to switch again.

*Note:* I may or may not fix the formatting of the older posts and better tag them depending on how much it annoys me. I've done some but there's at least 50 that still need fixing.
