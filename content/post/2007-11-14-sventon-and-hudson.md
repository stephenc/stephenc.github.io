This morning I  discovered sventon (http://www.sventon.org)  a Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/)  repository browser written in Java. And it's free!  Ten minutes later I had  this integrated as a Repository browser in Hudson (https://hudson.dev.java.net/ will  be available in build 1.157) and I'm loving it.  It's not quite as good as  fisheye... but it does everything I need it to!    

Hudson is  *really* starting to have kick-ass features that leave everything  else for dust.
