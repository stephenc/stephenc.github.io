<span>Question</span></div><div class=admonition-content><p><em>Is this a good way to manage commit access?</em></p><p>There was a reason for the Hamlet quote that I opened this post with.</p><p>Other communities can do things differently, for example the <a href=http://jenkins-ci.org/>Jenkins</a> project which I am also involved with gives out commit access to anyone who cares to ask for it&mldr; but commit access to core requires completing some paperwork, and access to infrastructure requires that you establish your merit.</p><p>Which is better? It all depends on who is asking and what they mean by better.</p><p>The reality is that &ldquo;It is what it is&rdquo;</p></div></div><p>TL;DR To become a Maven committer write good patches and get them applied.</p><p>What makes a good patch?</p><p>A good patch is a patch that applies cleanly and includes tests that cover both the positive and negative case and has documentation where relevant.</p><p>For example, if you were implementing a patch to fix <a href=http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-4612>MNG-4612</a> you would first need to write a test case that is failing when trying to encrypt</p><pre tabindex=0><code>{DESede}y+qq...==
</code></pre><p>and a second test case that is passing when trying to encrypt</p><pre tabindex=0><code>password
</code></pre><p>This is in order to be sure that you have written an effective test case that can pass for good data. Then you implement the fix and all the tests should pass. You then take a Subversion compatible<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> diff of the source code and attach that to the issue in question.</p><p>To understand how your patch gets evaluated, here is how I apply patches:</p><ol><li><p>I look at the actual diff, if there is a whole lot of formatting changes irrelevant to the issue being fixed => <strong>Patch is no good, ask on JIRA for a clean patch</strong></p></li><li><p>I look at the list of files in the diff, if there are no tests => <strong>Patch is no good, ask on JIRA for test cases</strong></p></li><li><p>I look at the issue and if the issue requires documentation be updated and there is no documentation changes in the patch => <strong>Patch is no good, ask on JIRA for documentation changes in the patch</strong></p></li><li><p>I take a clean checkout of the source that the patch applies to and try to apply the patch&mldr; if it does not apply clean => <strong>Patch is no good, ask on JIRA for an updated patch</strong></p></li><li><p>I revert the src/main and run the tests. If the tests all pass, then there are no test cases to catch the bug => <strong>Patch is no good, ask on JIRA for proper tests</strong></p></li><li><p>I revert src and run the tests. If any tests fail, then there is something wrong with the existing code => <strong>If I have time I might try and fix the issue, otherwise I just move on</strong></p></li><li><p>I apply the patch a second time and run the tests. If the tests all pass => <strong>Patch is good, I commit the patch and mark the JIRA as resolved.</strong></p></li></ol><p>So there you have it, my guide to writing good patches&mldr; now the next step is getting your patches noticed&mldr;</p><h2 id=how-to-get-your-patches-noticed>How to get your patches noticed</h2><p>The simplest way to get your patches noticed is to submit them to the JIRA issue that they fix.</p><p>Remember that the Maven project is run by volunteers in their spare time, so very often we may not notice your patch for a few days.</p><p>If you are certain that your patch is a good patch, and a week has passed with no comments on JIRA, then you should send one and only one email to the <a href=mailto:dev@maven.apache.org>dev@maven.apache.org</a> mailing list to see if your patch can get noticed.</p><div class="admonition note"><div class=admonition-header><svg viewBox="0 0 576 512"><path d="M0 64C0 28.7 28.7.0 64 0H224v128c0 17.7 14.3 32 32 32h128v125.7l-86.8 86.8c-10.3 10.3-17.5 23.1-21 37.2l-18.7 74.9c-2.3 9.2-1.8 18.8 1.3 27.5L64 512c-35.3.0-64-28.7-64-64V64zm384 64H256V0L384 128zM549.8 235.7l14.4 14.4c15.6 15.6 15.6 40.9.0 56.6l-29.4 29.4-71-71 29.4-29.4c15.6-15.6 40.9-15.6 56.6.0zM311.9 417 441.1 287.8l71 71L382.9 487.9c-4.1 4.1-9.2 7-14.9 8.4l-60.1 15c-5.5 1.4-11.2-.2-15.2-4.2s-5.6-9.7-4.2-15.2l15-60.1c1.4-5.6 4.3-10.8 8.4-14.9z"/></svg>
