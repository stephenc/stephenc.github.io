Initially we were working on the same team.

As they moved to newer and newer Hudson builds, the plugin kept on working (no recompile needed). I had my own plugins which were built for an earlier version of Hudson (my closed source SilkTest plugin, my original closed source AccuRev plugin [not to be confused with the open source one I subsequently developed and handed on to others to maintain]) which also were still working (with no recompile) in newer versions of Hudson</p><p>Recently, I met up with Peter, and he told me the sad news&mldr;. his plugin is now broken&mldr; it no longer works in the latest version of Jenkins&mldr; this was strange news to me, as before I left my previous employer to join CloudBees I&rsquo;d upgraded our CI servers to the latest and one of those was using Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Simple Cobertura plugin&rdquo; which did not seem broken&mldr;</p><p>After looking at Peter&rsquo;s code I finally found the problem&mldr; he was using the old javadoc annotation to mark the constructor as one for data binding, with one simple change:</p><p>6,7d5</p><p>&lt; import org.kohsuke.stapler.DataBoundConstructor;</p><p>&lt;</p><p>22a21</p><blockquote><pre><code> * @stapler-constructor
</code></pre></blockquote><p>24d22</p><p>&lt; @DataBoundConstructor</p><p>His plugin was back in action&mldr; Now I was puzzled, as I couldn&rsquo;t understand how I&rsquo;d upgraded this old old plugin from Hudson 1.129 and got it running on Jenkins 1.397 without recompiling&mldr;</p><p>Well I found out the answer, the version Peter had left in behind, didn&rsquo;t use the data bound constructor at all&mldr; it was doing</p><p>public Publisher newInstance(StaplerRequest req) throws FormException {</p><p>return new C2Publisher(req.getParameter(&ldquo;c2_coverReportDir&rdquo;));</p><p>}</p><p>While the code Peter had was doing  public C2Publisher newInstance(StaplerRequest req, JSONObject obj)</p><p>throws FormException {</p><p>return req.bindParameters(C2Publisher.class, &ldquo;c2_&rdquo;);</p><p>}</p><p>If you change it back to the old way, and you have enough Maven-foo to build against that old a version of Jenkins (née Hudson) you can end up with a plugin that works on both Hudson 1.129 and Jenkins 1.413&mldr;</p><p>I am fairly sure that if I had a SilkTest license and a copy of the SilkTest plugin that I wrote against Hudson 1.96, it would also still run unmodified on Jenkins 1.413.</p><p>How many projects can maintain that level of backwards compatibility.</p><p>[1] Peter wanted to have the coverage results on the main page, and at the time Kohsuke did not want to allow plugins to add columns to the main page&mldr; I came up with the compromise of adding a column which would be just one icon wide and have a tooltip to which plugins could contribute information&mldr; and that was the birth of the weather (health) icons[2]</p><p>[2] at the time Peter thought it would be cool if he could generate his own weather icon on the fly so that if you had high code coverage that would be a full umbrella while poor code coverage would be a tattered umbrella with no fabric and only the frame remaining&mldr; this is actually part of the API, so the technology to implement this has been there since 1.115&mldr; just nobody has done it&mldr; yet!</p></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><script type=application/javascript src=https://stephenc.github.io/js/toc.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://stephenc.github.io/css/toc.css></div><footer style="text-align:center;padding:20px;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin-top:40px"><p style=margin:0;color:#666;font-size:14px>© 2025 Stephen Connolly
