&lt;p&gt;The platform has changed a lot since then, and not always for the better. Many posts no longer render the way they used to, and a few images have disappeared entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature I really loved, which is now broken, was the ability to email a special address and have the message automatically turned into a post. It made publishing effortless… though that was also before I discovered what was then X (née Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
