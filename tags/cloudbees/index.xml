&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006 I started working for my previous employer, just a month or two after Peter Reilly started. Initially we were working on the same team. This was a team who&amp;rsquo;s CI system was a nightly cron job that emailed off a list of failing tests to everyone&amp;hellip; obviously Peter and I had many a WTF over that old system&amp;hellip; so I convinced our boss that we should put some effort into setting up a proper CI system&amp;hellip; Initially this was CruiseControl (as he thought Hudson at version 1.64 was too new and unheard of&amp;hellip; go with the old reliable)&amp;hellip; but after a couple of pains with the CruiseControl system (monolithic xml config file), we convinced him to switch to Hudson&amp;hellip; (I don&amp;rsquo;t think we ever looked back!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Continuously deploy your java apps to the cloud</title><link>https://stephenc.github.io/post/2011-05-18-continuously-deploy-your-java-apps-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephenc.github.io/post/2011-05-18-continuously-deploy-your-java-apps-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://stephenc.github.io/post/2011-05-17-deploy-your-java-apps-to-the-cloud/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I showed how easy it is to run your java application on CloudBees&amp;rsquo; RUN@cloud service. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the CloudBees Deployer plugin for Jenkins that allows you to deploy your app to the cloud from your CI server. I am using the DEV@cloud Jenkins service for my CI infrastructure, but you can use this plugin from your own Jenkins (or Nectar) server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first step is to install the CloudBees Deployer plugin&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deploy your java apps to the cloud</title><link>https://stephenc.github.io/post/2011-05-17-deploy-your-java-apps-to-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stephenc.github.io/post/2011-05-17-deploy-your-java-apps-to-the-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I work for &lt;a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/"&gt;CloudBees Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, they are a great company with great products. I have mostly been working on the &lt;a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/dev.cb"&gt;DEV@&lt;/a&gt; side of the fence which is focused on continuous integration and basically the development side of your application, but we also have the &lt;a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/run.cb"&gt;RUN@&lt;/a&gt; side of the fence where we provide a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service"&gt;platform as a service (PaaS)&lt;/a&gt; for running your java web applications on the cloud. I could give you the sales pitch, but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it at: the technologies and people behind RUN@ were one of the key reasons why I decided to join CloudBees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
